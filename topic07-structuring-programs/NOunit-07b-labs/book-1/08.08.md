#Example using MyFirstProject - part one - creating new folder in library 

 - We create a new sub-folder in \src called *Split*
 - We create a new file in *Split* called *LibSplit.hs*
 - To start insert the following code: 

~~~
module Split.LibSplit where
~~~

(we will put in more code later - this is just to see the simplest case compile)


We then need to put in our Split file into the *exposed-modules* part of the *library*

~~~
  exposed-modules: 
    - Lib  
    - Split.LibSplit
~~~

Then run:

~~~
$stack build
..
$stack install
..
$MyFirstProject-exe
~~~
and all should run as before. 

(note your package.yaml should look like below: )

# Updating dependencies using Stack

We need to update *package.yaml* for two reasons: 

- When we are structuring our code as seen in the default stack structure, 
we may write many functions, then curate these related functions into (files in) folders of related functions, for example if we had a lot of sorting functions, 
we might put all such code in (files in) a *Sort* folder. To use this code we need to tell package where code is situated. 

- When we are depending on libraries that are not available in standard ways (i.e. a simple import is not sufficient), we need to put the needed library in the 
dependencies list. Then during the stack build, any such uninstalled will be installed, and so be there for future builds. 

**Note** There is a hidden folder *.stack-work* where these installations reside. 

In our next example, we will pad out the structure of *MyFirstProject * including adding outside libraries and writing our own.

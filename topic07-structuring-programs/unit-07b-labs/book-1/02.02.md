# What is Stack

- Stack is a cross-platform program for developing Haskell projects. 

- Its main feature is that it 'sandboxes' the full installation of ghc, dependencies and code in the one isolated location. 

- This means that you can safely run different versions of dependencies in different sandboxes. 

- You can export the project as a fully standalone artefact that does not depend on any local versions of software.

- We will use the standard project structure in our projects as provided in the default installation, i.e.   ![structure of default stack structure(MyFirstProject)](./img/01.png)

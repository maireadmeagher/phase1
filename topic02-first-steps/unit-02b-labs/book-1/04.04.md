# Using GHC
 - To load compiled code. 
 - Using the terminal, cd to your working directory. (this just makes the loading simpler)
 - Create a simple Haskell script:

~~~
main = print (fac 20)

fac 0 = 1
fac n = n * fac (n-1)
~~~

Call it, e.g.  'Main.hs'

  - load the script (Main.hs)  
![](./img/03.png)

 - This compiles it as well as loading it.  You can now call the fac function: 

- ![run the fac function ](./img/04.png)

- You can also call the main function:     
![run the main function ](./img/05.png)


 - If you make any changes to the script, you need to reload it (thus recompiling it) : 

 ![reload the script ](./img/06.png)

There are a number of important and useful commands:

 - Quit GHCi: :q
 - Load a file into GHCi (autocompletion also applies to files): :l FILENAME
 - Re-load the file which is currently loaded into GHCi: :r
 -List the type signatures of all functions in the currently loaded file: :browse
- Print the type of a given expression: :t EXPRESSION

- A list of GHCi commands is available  <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.4.1/docs/html/users_guide/ghci-commands.html" target="_blank">here</a>   

- When you need to use a terminal command, just use :!

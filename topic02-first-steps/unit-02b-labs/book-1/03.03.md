# Running simple Haskell programs

- We can execute small simple programs using GHCi (i for interactive) alone. 
- To practice this, firstly run the GHCi interpreter (as per previous page). A prompt is displayed > 
- Use GHCi to evaluate the following: 

## Exercise 1
~~~
2+3
~~~

## Exercise 2
~~~
2*3
~~~

## Exercise 3
`div` is the infix integer division operator (note the quotes character - backward quote)
~~~
7 `div` 2
~~~

## Exercise 4
Select the first element of a non-empty list:
~~~
head [1,2,3,4,5]
~~~

## Exercise 5
Remove the first elemenet of a non-empty list: 
~~~
tail [1,2,3,4,5]
~~~

## Exercise 6
Select the first n elements of a list: 
~~~
take 3  [1,2,3,4,5]
~~~


## Exercise 7
Remove the first n elements of a list: 
~~~
drop 3  [1,2,3,4,5]
~~~

## Exercise 8
Select the nth element of a list (from index 0): 
~~~
[1,2,3,4,5] !! 3
~~~

## Exercise 9
Calculate the length of a list:
~~~
length [1,2,3,4,5] 
~~~

## Exercise 10
Calculate the sum of a list:
~~~
sum [1,2,3,4,5] 
~~~

## Exercise 11
Calculate the product of a list:
~~~
product [1,2,3,4,5] 
~~~
## Exercise 12
Append two lists:
~~~
[1,2,3,4,5]  ++ [4,6,7,8]
~~~
## Exercise 13
Calculate the reverse of a list:
~~~
reverse [1,2,3,4,5] 
~~~
## Exercise 14
Prepend an element to a  list:
~~~
1: [2,3,4,5] 
~~~

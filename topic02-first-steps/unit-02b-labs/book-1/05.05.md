# Source Code Editors

It is your choice as to the editor you use. Some suggestions are 

 - Visual Studio Code (recommended)

 - Atom (for Macs)

 - Sublime Text

Having installed a working version of GHC, it is helpful to install a source code editor early in the semester. 

## Visual Studio Code

 It is recommended to use VS Code with the Haskell plugin and a terminal from within VS Code to run the Haskell script opened in the VS Code editor. This is the least cumbersone approach. 


  - You should ensure that a **Haskell** extension is installed as an Extension. (This should happen automatically)

  - A **linter** (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)" target="_blank">what's a linter?</a>).It's not necessary, especially at the beginning but will be very useful later on.

  - Note that the vsCode extension (I suggest **hlint** or **haskell-linter**) is essentially a wrapper for the **hlint** program(<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hlint" target="_blank">here</a>). This may be a little tricky to set up but is worth the effort.

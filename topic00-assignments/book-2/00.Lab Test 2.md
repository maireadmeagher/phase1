# Lab Class Test 2

Details of Lab Test 2

## Aim

To test your level of competance with Stack, structuring projects, creating  managing dependences and developing a working Stack package. 


## Marks
This will be worth 5%. 

## Task

This is an open book exam so you can use your notes, etc. . When submitting this work, you will be agreeing that the work is your own and that you have not contacted any member of your class or other person to help you in this work. 

The questions will be very similar in nature to the exercises in [lab05]( https://tutors.dev/lab/fun-prog-24/topic07-structuring-programs/unit-07b-labs/book-2/03)

So what is being assessed is:

- your ability to create a stack package 
- your ability to  write your own modules and call the their functions in the main function. (I will tell you exactly what the spec of these modules are)
-  your ability to manage functions from outside libraries. For this part, I will tell you exactly which library you need. You need to be able to configure the stack package to be able to use the relevant functions of this package. This will involve the :
  - importing of the package into your program
  - and (in some cases,  when the package is not in base) updating the package.yaml

The lab test will be published through GitHub Classroom on Tuesday  during the 12:15 class and will take at most one hour.

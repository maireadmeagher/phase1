# Lab Class test

Details of  lab class test 1.

## Aim

To test your level of competence with GHCI and basic Haskell

## When
This lab test will take place on Thursday, 8th February in class

## Marks
This will be worth 5%. 

## Task

You will need to log into Moodle and the lab test will be made available through Moodle. This will involve being given a number of files as per sample test below. Each section will have instructions.

You will be asked to upload a zipped version of your changed files  through Moodle and asked to state that the work was your own (you can use any notes, internet, ghc material that helps you). 



A sample  exam is given [here](./archives/haskell_lab_test.zip)

(Note In both the sample exam and the actual exam that the prelude.hs file is for your information only - I have commented it out as you need to load the current version - this automatically happens if you *don't* have a local prelude.hs)

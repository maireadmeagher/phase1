\frametitle{Beta Reduction}

When we apply a function to an argument, we
\begin{itemize}
\item substitute the input expression for all instances of bound variables within the body of the abstraction
\item eliminate the head of the abstraction (its only purpose was to bind a variable)
\end{itemize}
This process is called beta reduction.

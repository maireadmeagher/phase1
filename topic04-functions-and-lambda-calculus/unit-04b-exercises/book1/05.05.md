# Exercises on address example

Based on the address example (code in previous tab), make the following changes to the code:

1. Add a new location (ucd) which has the address "University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland,  D04 V1W8". The rule of the name and address is that "Esq" should be printed after each person's name. Check this in GHCI.
2. Add another location (tcd) which has another address "*Trinity College Dublin*, the University of Dublin College Green Dublin 2,Ireland, D02 PN40 ". The rule here is that only the last name should be part of the name and address.

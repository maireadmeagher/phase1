# Sorting Examples

This example is based on the sorting example in Lecture 4.3. Create a file called **sorting.hs** and copy the following code into it (you can use copy and paste, but please be sure to understand the code).

We will use the Data.List module (and the sort and sortBy functions)

 ~~~haskell
import Data.List ( sort, sortBy )
 ~~~
Then we will look at a list of names, where the names are in the form of a 2-tuple, the first element being the first name and the second element being the last name
~~~haskell
names :: [(String, String)]
names = [("Angela", "Merkel"), ("Joe", "Biden"), ("Michael D", "Higgins"), ("Boris", "Johnson")]
~~~

We can check how the default sort works. Having loaded the 

~~~terminal
 > sort names
~~~
Should return: 

~~~terminal
[("Angela","Merkel"),("Boris","Johnson"),("Joe","Biden"),("Michael D","Higgins")]
~~~

Note that the default sort is ascending on the first element of the tuple. 

If we wish to define our own sort, we do so as follows:

```haskell
compareLastNames :: Ord a => (a, a) -> (a, a) -> Ordering
compareLastNames name1 name2 
           | lastName1 > lastName2 = GT 
           | lastName1 < lastName2 = LT
           | otherwise = EQ
    where   lastName1 = snd name1
            lastName2 = snd name2
 
```

This compares the second element of two 2-tuples (last name) and returns either 

- GT (greater than) (if the last name in the first tuple is aplhabetically greater than the last name in the second 2-tuple)
- LT (less than)  (if the last name in the first tuple is aplhabetically less than the last name in the second 2-tuple)
- EQ(equal)  (if the last name in the first tuple is aplhabetically equal to the last name in the second 2-tuple)

This is used with **sortBy**  and is an example of a function being used as an argument to another function. This can be used thus:

```
> sortBy compareLastNames names
```

This says "sort based on the logic in  **compareLastNames**" which should return

```
[("Joe","Biden"),("Michael D","Higgins"),("Boris","Johnson"),("Angela","Merkel")]
```

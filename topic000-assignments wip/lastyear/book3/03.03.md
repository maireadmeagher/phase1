## Reading in the data from text file and cleaning

The following code : 

~~~
extractWords :: Text -> [Text]
extractWords t =  ws
  where
    ws = map Data.Text.toCaseFold $ filter (not . T.null)
         $ map cleanWord $ Data.Text.words t
    cleanWord = T.dropAround (not . isLetter)
~~~



takes one Text (e.g. unprocessed input from file) and returns a list of text.
Note the use of 'as pattern' here (later)


Next look at the following code : 

~~~
allWordsReport :: String -> [Text] -> Text
allWordsReport msg words =
  fmt $ nameF (Data.Text.Internal.Builder.fromString msg)  $ unlinesF words
~~~

This uses the Format library and the fmt function. It is a formatting library. in this case it attaches a name (msg) to a list(of Text), line by line. 

Then, we have the code to read in a text file into one Text object. Using the Data.Text.IO library, 

~~~
textVar <- Data.Text.IO.TIO.readFile flName
~~~

where flName is the file name including path if not in current directory.

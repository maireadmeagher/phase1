#Suggested Plan of Attack

I suggest the following plan of attack for this assignment. 

1. You should start by looking at the code given in Step 3. This code shows how to read in a file and return a list of Text. 

2. Try out this code on some text files. 

3. Then try to see how you would take two lists (of Text) and return words that are 
   1. in the dictionary
   2. not in the dictionary
   (There are many ways to to this - you may start doing it one way and end up using another)
Write this function 

4. Then write a function that allows the user to replace the incorrectly spelled words with another word. (To start, just accept the word that the user has typed in, then you should improve this to check and allow the user to re-enter the word until a valid word is entered by the user).
   
5. Print out the changed words (only).
   
6. For the extra marks, you should try to print out the original list of words, except that any originally invalid words are replaced  with the changed(valid)  words, whilst maintaining the  original order.

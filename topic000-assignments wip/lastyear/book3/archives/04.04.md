## As-pattern in haskell

As-patterns are a handy way to be abke to pattern match on part of something and still refer to the entire value. Some examples : 

## Example 1

~~~
f :: Show a => (a,b) -> IO (a,b)
f t@(a,b) = do
     print a
     return t
~~~

Here, we pattern match on a tuple so we can get the first value for printing but use the @ symbl to introduce a binding named t in order to refer to the whole tuple rather than just a part. 

~~~
> s (2,1)
 1
 (1,2)
~~~

## Example 2
~~~
doubleUp [a] -> [a]
doubleUp [] = []
doubleUp xs@(x:_) = x: xs

> doublep[]
[]

> doubleUp[1,2]
[1,1,2]

> doubleUp[1,2, 3]
[1,1,2,3]

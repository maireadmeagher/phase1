# 2. Assignment Approach

We will be using GitHub Classroom for this assignment. I am assuming you are using VS Code - if not just ignore the steps that mention VSCode and ensure that you have an appropriately helpful IDE to work with. Also, if you have not used VS Code, note what you used and how you set it up. 


## Overall Steps in the Assignment:


1. *Accepting the Assignment*: You will be given an **invite link** to the assignment in our GitHub Classroom area.  When you click on the link, you accept the assignment from our Github Classroom; this will create a new **remote repository** for you in my classroom area in GitHub.

Details: 
To start working on it, click on this invite link:
TODO
<https://classroom.github.com/a/x_kMjvxX>  Get this link

Please follow the usual process. Any difficulties, just let me know. 
You will be prompted to authorise GitHub classroom:



To use this in VSCode (recommended), you need to add the GitHub Classroom extension to your VS Code install.

3. You will then see:

5. *Clone via VS Code*: You will then **clone** this remote repo onto your **local machine (via VSCode)**.  This will setup a local project in VSCode for you with starter code. (empty stack project)

6. Complete the assignment, as per spec. You should regularly commit and push the code. 

6.  *Submitting*: When you are ready to submit, you will ensure that you have pushed your last commit to GitHub.  You will also zip your code and submit it via the dropbox in Moodle.  Both of these must be done by the submission date.

# Date of submission, Marking Scheme 

## Date of Submission
The  deadline is Friday, 5th May at 18:00 with interviews on the following week. 


Interview
You will be interviewed on this assignment. It is alright (and expected) that you use the case study extensively but you MUST understand the code that you submit. For the other functions, you can use similar ideas but the more different the better. 
Reference any material (outside the material directly given by me) including any use of AI bots.

| Clarity, appropriateness, elegance, haskell-ness of code (including naming) | 20   |



Also, clearly describe any extra functionality in your readme.md. 

The mark for the interview (which tests your authorship and  understanding of the code ) will take place in week after submission and will be used as a multiplier for the code. 
It follows that the interview is mandatory. You need to be available following the submission of the assignment. Schedule will be available nearer the time.


Please note that if. you submit early, I can be available to interview at a time that suits both of us.

#Suggested Plan of Attack 

I suggest the following plan of attack for this assignment. 

1. You should read the  **stockQuotes**  example.

2. Make changes to the code given, add in more analysis, ensure that you understand that code.

3. Download your starter code from [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/x3Tw6eai).
   
4. Design your  data type (Similar to QuoteData). 

5. Work on calculations.

6. Test it on simple text to console.

7.  Try a simple generation of html to a file. (From the Main.hs)

8.  Work this until there is full versions of data (analogous to the html in StockQuotes example) being reported to the HTML File. Ensure that you have generated all specified reports.

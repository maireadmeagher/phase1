# Exercises on Loops

# Programming Fundamentals 1 & 2

# Mairead Meagher, Siobhan Roche

1.  Write a method (***exer1()*** ) to print numbers from 1 to 10, one
    number per line.

2.  Write a method ***(exer2())*** to print numbers from 15 to 20
    inclusive, one number per line.

3.  Write a method ***(exer3())*** to print numbers backwards from 10 to
    1 inclusive, one number per line.

4.  Write a method ***(exer4())*** to print numbers backwards from 20 to
    15 inclusive, one number per line.

5.  Write a method ***(exer5())*** to sum the numbers from 1 to 10
    inclusive. You should print the sum to the console. (sum is 55)

6.  Write methods to print the following (name the methods
    ***exer6_1(),*** etc) :
    ![](media/image1.png){style="width:6.26389in;height:3.39444in"}

7.  Write a method ***exer7(int numRows, int numCols)*** which prints a
    rectangle of '\*'s with *numRows* lines and *numCols* asterisks
    across in each line. So a call of exer7(4, 10) would display the
    rectangle as in exercise 6.1 above

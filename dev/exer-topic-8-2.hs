-- Exercise 3
-- Write powers that takes a number and creates a list of that number squared, cubed, and quadrupled.

-- Exercise 4
-- Assume people are dining. We have a list of tip percents (assume people tip at different rates):
-- *Main> let pcts = [0.15, 0.2, 0.21]
-- 5. We have a list of bills (what people owe, minus tip)
-- *Main> let amts = [20.5, 30, 25]
-- Write calcBill that takes amts and pcts and calculates what each person will pay, based on their amt and pct. Then apply a 4% tax rate.
-- *Main>calcBillamtspcts
-- [24.518,37.44,31.46]

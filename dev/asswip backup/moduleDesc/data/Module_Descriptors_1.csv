"Timber production in Ireland is forecast to expand from the current three million cubic metres per annum to six million cubic metres per annum over the next fifteen years, according to the All Ireland Roundwood Production Forecast 2011 to 2028, published by COFORD. Additionally, forest area continues to expand as state policy supports additional afforestation under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme 2014-2020. Forests produce fuel, in addition to roundwood for fibre and timber products. Quantifying carbon stored in forests is also increasingly important. Expanding the professional capacity in the reliable measurement and quantification of diverse forest products is important in optimising the benefits of Ireland's forest resource. This module is designed to develop the student's knowledge of assessment of forest stand parameters and quantification of timber in logs, individual trees and forest stands. The student will develop technical competence in the use of a wide range of forest measurement equipment during field-based practicals. The student will understand the conventions used in measuring, recording, calculating and presenting quantification results, and the limitations of these results due to errors.","['<40%: Very limited knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.

"Sustainable production of timber, fibre and fuel from forests is dependent on implementing the appropriate harvesting methods and systems on each site. Harvesting operations impact forest regeneration, forest health and productivity over time. Harvesting must be implemented ensuring safety of staff and the public and protection of soil, water, biodiversity and archaeological features, in accordance with regulatory guidelines.

Expanding professional capacity in this area will be vital in realising this expansion opportunity. In this module students will gain specialist knowledge on the harvesting methods and systems employed in sustainable harvesting, and the limitations of these systems due to site conditions. Students will gain skills in designing a harvest plan, assessing harvesting productivity and production cost, carrying out an Environmental Impact Assessment, diagnosing site specific safety issues and constraints on harvesting, and identifying appropriate solutions. To enable students to carry out this work, they will be given an in-depth knowledge of harvesting-related equipment, safety procedures, machine productivity and operation cost and environmental issues.","['<40%: Very limited knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.

"This module is a general introduction to the management and conservation of biological diversity. The module is divided into four parts. (1) This part provides an outline of the major elements of global biodiversity, its geographical distribution and evolution and examines the threats to biodiversity and the need to manage and conserve it. (2) This part focuses on conservation at species and population level, looking at the techniques and opportunities available for both in situ and ex situ conservation. (3) Introduces management and conservation issues at an ecosystem level, e.g. coastal, riparian, plantation forest, farmland etc. Protected areas form a critical conservation tool at this level, and the module examines the categories of protected areas, criteria for selection etc. The opportunities for habitat restoration and species reintroduction are also explored.

"This is a 10 credit module whose final outcome is a comprehensive five-year Forest Management Plan for a medium-sized property. The demands on forestry as a provider of timber, recreation, environmental and social benefits are ever increasing and complex. In order to reach a sustainable balance, foresters need planning tools. In this module students will experience the planning process of a Forest Management Plan. The focus of the module will allow students to gain professional skills in using models for timber growth, and calculating clear-fell and thinning yield. In preparing a Forest Management Plan for a five-year period the student will have to synthesise all the knowledge and skills acquired over the three programme years. Preparing a plan will have to be done with the forest owner's aims and objectives in mind, as well as the constraints given by legislation, environmental guidelines and local social issues.","['<40%: Very limited knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.

This module will study the options available and examine HDL in terms of its translation into hardware elements or synthesis. The operating characteristics, manufacturers specifications and applications of D/A and A/D converters will be investigated. Address decoding schemes, together with good design principles and troubleshooting techniques will also be covered.","['70% - 100%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at an excellent level; demonstrated a comprehensive knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved an excellent level of the skills required for the subject matter; demonstrated the ability to carry out further investigation and problem solving associated with the subject matter.', '60% - 69%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a very good level; demonstrated a detailed knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a very good level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '50% - 59%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a good level; demonstrated a good knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a good level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '40% - 49%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a basic level; demonstrated a basic knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a basic level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '<40%: The learner has not: attained the module learning outcomes; demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the associated subject matter; demonstrated a sufficient level of the skills required for the subject matter.']","[{'learning outcomes': '1,2,3,4,5', 'main': True, 'name': 'Final Written Examination', 'weighting': 50}, {'learning outcomes': '', 'main': True, 'name': 'Continuous Assessment', 'weighting': 50}, {'learning outcomes': '1,2,3,4,5', 'main': False, 'name': 'In-Class Assessment', 'weighting': 15}, {'learning outcomes': '3,5,6', 'main': False, 'name': 'Practical', 'weighting': 35}]",A11922_-_CaM_-_Elec_-_Digital_Systems,[],A11922,5,Engineering Technology,False,"['Floyd, T. \\emph{Digital Fundamentals}. 11th ed..

"This is the first telecommunications module presented in this course. Further telecommunications modules will be covered in years 3 and 4. In this module, the basic theory of analogue and digital telecommunications is introduced, from both a baseband and broadband perspective. Since it is the first of the telecommunications to be delivered, there is a greater emphasis on analogue telecommunications to establish fundamental principles and towards framing the discipline from the historical perspective. A description and analysis of different analogue and digital modulation methods are covered, modeled using both numerical techniques and software packages (e.g. Scilab) and circuit level simulators (e.g. LTSpice), and then applied to a number of historical and modern telecommunications systems. Modern transceiver architectures are explored. A practical program runs in parallel with lectures and tutorials to enhance and reinforce the student's understanding of the theory, using experience and technical information gleaned from the numerical modeling and circuit level simulations. The student is expected to have a robust grounding in mathematics, A.C & D.C. circuit theory, and analogue and digital electronics.","['70% - 100%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at an excellent level; demonstrated a comprehensive knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved an excellent level of the skills required for the subject matter; demonstrated the ability to carry out further investigation and problem solving associated with the subject matter.', '60% - 69%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a very good level; demonstrated a detailed knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a very good level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '50% - 59%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a good level; demonstrated a good knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a good level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '40% - 49%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a basic level; demonstrated a basic knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a basic level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '<40%: The learner has not: attained the module learning outcomes; demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the associated subject matter; demonstrated a sufficient level of the skills required for the subject matter.']","[{'learning outcomes': '1,2,3,4,5', 'main': True, 'name': 'Final Written Examination', 'weighting': 70}, {'learning outcomes': '', 'main': True, 'name': 'Continuous Assessment', 'weighting': 30}, {'learning outcomes': '1,2,3,4,5', 'main': False, 'name': 'In-Class Assessment', 'weighting': 10}, {'learning outcomes': '6,7', 'main': False, 'name': 'Practical', 'weighting': 20}]",A11941_-_CaM_-_DataComm_-_Introductory_Telecoms_Theory,[],A11941,5,Engineering Technology,False,"['Carlson, B. \\emph{Communication Systems}. 4th ed..

"Information theory and the restrictions and guidelines it presents for digital communication are treated. The role of probability in quantifying information and redundancy is treated leading to source coding, and channel coding. Signal space is presented and the error performance of M-ary FSK and PSK modulation schemes is developed. The bandwidth efficiency plane is then populated for these schemes, leading to power/bandwidth trade-offs and the Shannon limit. Satellite systems are explored as a case study in digital communications. Basic features of GPS, Radar and optical communications are surveyed.","['70% - 100%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at an excellent level; demonstrated a comprehensive knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved an excellent level of the skills required for the subject matter; demonstrated the ability to carry out further investigation and problem solving associated with the subject matter.', '60% - 69%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a very good level; demonstrated a detailed knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a very good level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '50% - 59%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a good level; demonstrated a good knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a good level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '40% - 49%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a basic level; demonstrated a basic knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a basic level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '<40%: The learner has not: attained the module learning outcomes; demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the associated subject matter; demonstrated a sufficient level of the skills required for the subject matter.']","[{'learning outcomes': '1,2,3,4,5', 'main': True, 'name': 'Final Written Examination', 'weighting': 70}, {'learning outcomes': '', 'main': True, 'name': 'Continuous Assessment', 'weighting': 30}, {'learning outcomes': '1,2,3,4,5', 'main': False, 'name': 'In-Class Assessment', 'weighting': 10}, {'learning outcomes': '6', 'main': False, 'name': 'Practical', 'weighting': 20}]",A11990_-_CaM_-_Elec_-_Digital_Communication_Analysis,[],A11990,5,Engineering Technology,False,"['Sklar, B. \\emph{Digital Communications, Fundamentals and Applications}. 2nd ed..

"The student will learn that while the existing electrical power, transmission and distribution system has served the world well that a number of factors including the intermittency of the increasingly important renewable resources mean that a more agile, monitored and distributed grid, a smart grid, will form a part of their future. This course begins by highlighting the bountiful but unreliable nature of the dominant renewables in use on the electrical grid, wind, hydro and solar photovoltaic. The matching of supply and demand, as well as unyielding target of mains frequency together with the only slightly less rigid voltage targets, will then be covered. At this point, the challenge should be clear, so the final sections of the course deal with the solution and technology that would make up the smart grid. This begins with consumer monitoring and incentives through smart metering and demand side management, follows on with technology to automatically address grid problems and finally is completed with an overview of energy storage technologies. Practical work will involve building an automated measurement system based on LabVIEW and using the Smart Grid Project developed in the previous year of the course.","['70% - 100%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at an excellent level; demonstrated a comprehensive knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved an excellent level of the skills required for the subject matter; demonstrated the ability to carry out further investigation and problem solving associated with the subject matter.', '60% - 69%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a very good level; demonstrated a detailed knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a very good level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '50% - 59%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a good level; demonstrated a good knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a good level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '40% - 49%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a basic level; demonstrated a basic knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a basic level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '<40%: The learner has not: attained the module learning outcomes; demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the associated subject matter; demonstrated a sufficient level of the skills required for the subject matter.']","[{'learning outcomes': '', 'main': True, 'name': 'Continuous Assessment', 'weighting': 100}, {'learning outcomes': '1,2,3', 'main': False, 'name': 'In-Class Assessment', 'weighting': 40}, {'learning outcomes': '4,5', 'main': False, 'name': 'Project', 'weighting': 60}]",A13361_-_CaM_-_Engi_-_Smart_Grid_Technology_-_Renewable_Energies,[],A13361,5,Engineering Technology,False,"['National Instruments Online. \\emph{Getting Started with NI LabView Student Training} .. 2010.', 'Sumper, A. and A.

"The key success factors associated with the effective design, development, deployment and use of advanced digital information technologies are primarily non-technical, human factors associated with complexity in either the systems that are needed, the context in which the system is being deployed, or both. When not addressed these factors impinge upon both technical development activities and systems management processes in unexpected ways and often contribute to high levels of systems failure or result in systems which fail to meet their objectives. The challenge for systems professionals is to design and use systems development methodologies that create viable, effective, sustainable systems that support modern organisations and their decision making processes in all their complexity.

"International development agencies and NGOs are growing sectors with a traditionally low levels of IS knowledge, but in which demand for IS knowledge is increasing. This has created new career opportunities for IS professionals in agencies such as the United Nations, World Bank, NGOs and international banks asd well as in broader sectors dealing with mirgation, poverty, disaster response and recovery etc.. Information systems play a key role through the creation, for example, of effective, IT-enabled, inter-organisational networks and supply chains which reduce transaction costs, speed up response to trends and events, create productive and efficient access pathways to IT-mediated global marketplaces. Also, international agencies are implementing digitally-enabled systems to support rapid response and agency coordination in disaster recovery, conflict and other emergency situations. On the policy side, rich data is needed to understand development contexts and inform and evaluate policy and other interventions.

"This module incorporates two components, (i) Cell Design and (ii) Measurement & Inspection. Cell Design concentrates on how to design, implement and manage manual cells. A manual cell in this context is a modern approach to man management in manufacture and assembly: it consists of a small group of people (generally from 3 to 12) who work as a tightly knit team, in a batch type production situation where they control the pace and quality of the work they are doing. The objective is that they will be sufficiently self-motivated to improve their activities continuously and work with little or no supervision. Measurement & Inspection focuses on traditional & state of the art measurement and inspection techniques that may be utilised for the purpose of quality assurance, quality control, and indeed product/process design and improvement. A fundamental theme is the fitness-for-purpose and the versatility of a given technique based on key characteristics such as uncertainty, accuracy, precision, achievable resolution, data acquisition speed, in-line capability and cost implications. These key aspects are explored across the spectrum of techniques from contact and non-contact dimensional metrology to vision systems and 3-D surface topography.","['70% - 100%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at an excellent level; demonstrated a comprehensive knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved an excellent level of the skills required for the subject matter; demonstrated the ability to carry out further investigation and problem solving associated with the subject matter.', '60% - 69%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a very good level; demonstrated a detailed knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a very good level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '50% - 59%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a good level; demonstrated a good knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a good level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '40% - 49%: The learner has: attained the module learning outcomes at a basic level; demonstrated a basic knowledge of the associated subject matter; achieved a basic level of the skills required for the subject matter.', '<40%: The learner has not: attained the module learning outcomes; demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the associated subject matter; demonstrated a sufficient level of the skills required for the subject matter.']","[{'learning outcomes': '1,2,3,4,5,6', 'main': True, 'name': 'Final Written Examination', 'weighting': 70}, {'learning outcomes': '', 'main': True, 'name': 'Continuous Assessment', 'weighting': 30}, {'learning outcomes': '4,5,6', 'main': False, 'name': 'Assignment', 'weighting': 15}, {'learning outcomes': '1,2,3', 'main': False, 'name': 'In-Class Assessment', 'weighting': 15}]",A14727_-_S_-_Engi_-_Process_Technology,[],A14727,5,Engineering Technology,False,"['Dotson, C. \\emph{Fundamentals of Dimensional Metrology}. 6th Edition.

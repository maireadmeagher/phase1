-- Fix the error in the code below. Load the file, read the error message

-- and fix ONE ERROR at a time. Then load the file and read the next error

-- message. 

-- Note if either a change in the type of a function / value or  the value/definition will allow 

-- the code to compile, you can change either to make it error-free. 

-- Hint comment out all but the code you are currently working on. Leave all code uncommented before submission.

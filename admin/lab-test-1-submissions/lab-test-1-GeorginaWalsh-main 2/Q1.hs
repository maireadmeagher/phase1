--SECTION A - Fixing Errors- 40 Marks
-- Please fill in your name and student number
-- Student Name : Georgina Walsh
-- Student Number : 20093147

-- Fix the error in the code below. Load the file, read the error message

-- and fix ONE ERROR at a time. Then load the file and read the next error

-- message. 

-- Note if either a change in the type of a function / value or  the value/definition will allow 

-- the code to compile, you can change either to make it error-free. 

-- Hint comment out all but the code you are currently working on. Leave all code uncommented before submission.
